# 🔍 Day 3: GitHub User Finder
### Part of the 7-Day Web Dev Project Challenge

Today's project focuses on the **Fetch API** and **Asynchronous JavaScript**. This application allows users to search the live GitHub database to retrieve real-time developer statistics, bios, and repository counts.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5:** Dynamic UI structure.
- **CSS3:** Custom properties and "Slate & Neon" design system.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** `async/await`, `fetch`, and Template Literals.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Live API Integration:** Fetches data directly from the official GitHub REST API.
- **Error Handling:** Implemented `try...catch` blocks to handle non-existent users or network failures gracefully.
- **Enhanced UX:** - Real-time "Loading" states.
    - Keyboard support (search triggers on "Enter" key).
    - Mobile-responsive "Profile Card" layout.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Managing the execution flow while waiting for server responses.
- **JSON Data Parsing:** Converting raw API responses into usable JavaScript objects.
- **Dynamic DOM Injection:** Creating and rendering HTML components on the fly based on data received.
